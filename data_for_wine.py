        "description": "This dark, potent, full-bodied wine is made from two of the darkest, most tannic grape varieties—Petit Verdot and Petite Syrah—and there is nothing petite about this blend. Its color is almost black and opaque, while aromas and flavors suggest smoke, blueberry and espresso. The texture is tannic but not overbearing.",
